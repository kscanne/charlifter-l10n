The source code for the charlifter program itself is currently hosted on sourceforge, here:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/lingala/

The charlifter-l10n project you're looking at now is for localizations of the charlifter project (mostly translations of the names of the supported languages).   If you're interested in helping translate, check out http://www.transifex.net/projects/p/charlifter-l10n/


Steps:
  1. Create an account on transifex.net
  1. Visit [this page](http://www.transifex.net/projects/p/charlifter-l10n/teams/) and click "Request a New Team"
  1. Then you'll be able to find and manage your translation on the [overview page](http://www.transifex.net/projects/p/charlifter-l10n/c/default/).   Click the icon that looks like a paper and pencil next to your language to translate online.   Or there are links that let you download a PO file to translate offline.


Thanks!
